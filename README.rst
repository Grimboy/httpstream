HTTPStream
==========

**HTTPStream** is a simple and pragmatic HTTP client library for Python that
provides support for incremental JSON document retrieval and RFC 6570 URI
Templates.

HTTPStream is hosted on PyPI and so to install, simply use ``easy_install``
or - preferably - ``pip``::

    easy_install httpstream
    pip install httpstream

No external dependencies are required, the entire package is self-contained and
relies only on standard library components.

For further information on how to use HTTPStream, check out the pages on
`Read the Docs <https://httpstream.readthedocs.org/>`_.
